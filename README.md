# json_migrate_example
Import to Drupal 7 JSON (example)

## This example covers
* User migration
* Content migration
* Authoring of content
* Importing pictures declared in JSON file
* Importing creating/terms from JSON file

This basic example shows how to import JSON data into Drupal 7, it contains several files.
The JSON files contain the data to be imported, you can find these files in the *files* folder. They consist of all users and articles,
that will be imported. You can extend/modify this basic example to your needs.
Improvements/suggestions are welcome.

The *inc* folder includes all our custom migrate classes, they extend migrate base class.
They also set the destination class where your content will go to.

In *Migration_json_example.inc* files, contains our hook_migrate_api which will register our migrations with migrate,
so migrate is aware of our code.

To run this example, you will need to have migrate and migrate_ui installed.
Drush en -y migrate migrate_ui

## To get to work
1. Copy this 2 JSON files, where you can access them via an URL.
2. Update the *migration_json_example.module* file with these URLs.

Enable the module as you would any module in drupal, either via the Interface or drush.
drush en -y migration_json_example.

You must run first the users import then the article, you can import them via the migrate interface or via drush:
drush mi UserJsonMigration
drush mi ArticleJsonMigration

*To rollback on the migration*:
drush mr UserJsonMigration
drush mr ArticleJsonMigration
